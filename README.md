# Welcome to the Töchter & Söhne Code Challenge

**IMPORTANT: nothing has to be perfect or even finished. Just show us how you approach tasks like this. Good luck and have fun!**

In this code challenge you will create a web app with Meteor.js.
The goal is to code a fully functional todo list with the following features:

1. Create a simple Meteor app which runs locally.
2. Show a list of todos.
3. Add new todos via an input field.
4. Store your list of todos in some kind of database.
5. Delete a todo from the list via a button.
6. Mark a todo as done via a checkbox.

## TOO EASY? Here are some bonuses to impress us:

1. Click on a todo to open up a new window that runs a web search for that term.
2. Include the functionality to add a due date for a todo.
3. Make it pretty with some CSS!
